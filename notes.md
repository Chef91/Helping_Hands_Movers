This website is for Helping Hands Moving services. The objective is to create a static website in order for the owner, John Graham, push his marketing efforts and help the business succeed. In order to create a good quality static website we have chosen to use the minimal approach. That being said, this website will not heavily rely on JavaScript or or advanced languages. It will be a training ground and simple website for Mr. Graham to ge the word out about his business.
